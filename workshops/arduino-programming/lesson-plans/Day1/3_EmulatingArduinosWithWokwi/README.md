# Mini Project: 

Enough abstract code; let's play!  Tomorrow we'll be diving into Arduino basics with more structure, but first let's acquaint ourselves with what an Arduino is and what kinds of things people do with them!

Using the Simulated Arduino on the Wokwi website (https://wokwi.com/projects/new/arduino-uno), follow the Adafruit tutorial and wire up an LED so that the simulated arduino makes the LED blink.
