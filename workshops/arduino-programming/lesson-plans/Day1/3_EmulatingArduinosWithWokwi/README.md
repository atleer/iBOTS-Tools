# Mini Project: 

Enough abstract code; let's play!  Tomorrow we'll be diving into Arduino basics with more structure, but first let's acquaint ourselves with what an Arduino is and what kinds of things people do with them!

## 1: The "Hello World" of Arduinos: Blink

Using the Simulated Arduino on the Wokwi website (https://wokwi.com/projects/new/arduino-uno), follow the Adafruit tutorial and use the point-and-click interface to wire up an LED so that the simulated arduino makes the LED blink.

Tutorial: https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/basics/Blink/


## 2: Run the Simulation in VSCode

Once it's working on the website, we should be able to use it on our machine.  Install the PlatformIO and Wokwi Simulator VSCode extensions, `the diagram.json` file and the `sketch.ino` file will be enough to compile the code.  Initialize a New PlatformIO project using the extension, and it will show where to put the required files.
