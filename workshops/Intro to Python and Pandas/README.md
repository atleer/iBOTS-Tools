# iBOTS Workshop: Intro to Python and Pandas for Neuroscientists

5-day workshop, from the iBOTS Team:
- Lecture/Exercise from 09:00 - 12:30
- Office hours from 14:00 - 16:00

Lecture/Exercise sessions began with a small demo, two hands-on sessions with review after each hands-on. Each day participants worked on two notebooks (one per hands-on session).
