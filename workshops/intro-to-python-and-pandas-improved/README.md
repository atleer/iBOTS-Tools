### Setting up the environment

For this workshop we will be using Python and several Python packages commonly used for data analysis and visualization. Therefore, the set up involved installing Python as well as the required packages. Below are two options:

#### Option 1: GitPod

You can get started in GitPod environment where everything is already setup:

#### Option 2: Conda
Altenatively, you can also set up the environment on your PC using conda. Once you clone the repo, navigate to the workshop directory and run the following command:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml -y
```

This command creates a conda environment called `workshop-env` with all the necessary Python packages for this workshop.
