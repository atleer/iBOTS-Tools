Here is a place for all our learning projects. 

Want to learn how to write machine code? Or run jupyter-notebooks with 32 CPUs? Then here is where you document your learning progress and process. 

Each learning project is housed in a separate folder, which can contain anything you want.

The **only** requirement is include a README.md file that briefly explains what the learning project is.
