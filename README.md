# iBehave Summer School 2023 Workshopp

## Workshop Format: Group Programming

- we will be working in **teams of 4-5 people** where each team will **develop a Dashboard**
- teams are ranked based on the number of contributions they make to the dashboard development
- the top two dashboards will be displayed on the big screen and the winner dashboard will be selected by voting

**What is a "contribution"?** A contribution is a single commit indicating a change in the dashboard

### Working as a team

- members take turns to make thier contribution
- once you made your contribution pass the laptop to the person sitting on your right

### Rules

- each team can only use one laptop
- each member can make one and only one contribution (i.e. single commit)
- the laptop is never being passed to the left, unless the laptop needs to be passed to the first person in the row
- for safety reasons, the laptop should not leave the table
- each team can have a "free" member. The free member can leave the table to chat with other groups and get inspiration. However, **note** that the free member must still contribute and her/his turn cannot be skipped
